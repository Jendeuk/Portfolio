Decisions:
I tried my best to avoid using elements not explained in previous lectures, but did use some
other technologies aswell because I wanted the freedom to form the website as I initially designed it in Figma.
As this is an introductory assignment I started the project from scratch as intended and gradually built
it as it is. The CSS file along with the flexbox and grid was written all by myself.

I could also have splitted style.css in more files, but chose to not do it as this is supposed
to be a small project, it shouldn't be badly affected performance wise.
