            <h2>Preparations</h2>
            <p>
              Before I made this website, I already had some experience about
              HTML and CSS since high school. To begin with the website, I made
              a wireframe on how I want my website to look like. Even when I
              already had some experience, I do have to do some research for the
              codings. Therefore I also had to prepare a lot for this to make
              sure I added all the stuff i need for the website. After
              Preparation for the wireframe, I then move to the coding. Before I
              start this part, I had to make sure that i use the right semantic
              tags that I wanted to use in my code, which most of them I always
              start by using nav, main and footer for the page. And after that I
              just wrote down what i want to add in the coding.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>
              For the Structure, first of all I structured my files and folders
              in the way it would make it easier for me to find the files or
              folders I want to add or fix. All the page has their own files,
              also all the images has an old folder to make it more organize.
              After that I will make sure that all the h1 elements has same
              color and size to make it easier to look.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>HTML elements</h2>
            <p>
              For the HTML elements I already decide to use header, nav, main
              and footer for the website by following the sementic tags
              tamplate. This is very usefull since it will look more organized.
              In my header elements I added nav-bar so i can add what buttons or
              paragraphs I want. In the main element, I added section tags where
              I can put whatever I want for the main part which could be my info
              etc. And the last element is footer. Here I put the credit of the
              person who designed the page which Is me, so the users can tell
              who has the credits of the website.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>My decisions</h2>
            <p>
              Before starting the coding I had to research a lot to make sure
              that I have all the things I wanted to add to the website. For
              example I added grid and flex-box because I already have goe
              through these before, so its easier for me to use them to design
              my website since I have a bit experiens on it. For the next step,
              I will do more research and readings to understand what options is
              better to use on coding!
